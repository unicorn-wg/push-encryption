--- abstract

A message encryption scheme is described for the Web Push protocol.  This scheme
provides confidentiality and integrity for messages sent from an Application
Server to a User Agent.

# Introduction

The Web Push protocol {{!RFC8030}} is an intermediated protocol by necessity.
Messages from an Application Server are delivered to a User Agent via a Push
Service.

This document describes how messages sent using this protocol can be secured
against inspection, modification and falsification by a Push Service.

Web Push messages are the payload of an HTTP message {{?RFC7230}}.  These
messages are encrypted using an encrypted content encoding
{{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-encryption-encoding}}.  This document describes how this
content encoding is applied and describes a recommended key management scheme.

For efficiency reasons, multiple users of Web Push often share a central agent
that aggregates push functionality.  This agent can enforce the use of this
encryption scheme by applications that use push messaging.  An agent that only
delivers messages that are properly encrypted strongly encourages the end-to-end
protection of messages.

A web browser that implements the Web Push API {{API}} can enforce the use of
encryption by forwarding only those messages that were properly encrypted.


## Notational Conventions

The words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", and "MAY" are used in this document.
It's not shouting, when they are capitalized, they have the special meaning
described in {{!RFC2119}}.


# Push Message Encryption Overview {#overview}

Encrypting a push message uses elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) {{ECDH}} on
the P-256 curve {{FIPS186}} to establish a shared secret (see {{dh}}) and a
symmetric secret for authentication (see {{auth}}).

A User Agent generates an ECDH key pair and authentication secret that it
associates with each subscription it creates.  The ECDH public key and the
authentication secret are sent to the Application Server with other details of
the push subscription.

When sending a message, an Application Server generates an ECDH key pair and a
random salt.  The ECDH public key is encoded into the `keyid` parameter of the
encrypted content coding header, the salt in the `salt` parameter of that same
header (see Section 2.1 of {{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-encryption-encoding}}).  The
ECDH key pair can be discarded after encrypting the message.

The content of the push message is encrypted or decrypted using a content
encryption key and nonce that is derived using all of these inputs and the
process described in {{encryption}}.


## Key and Secret Distribution

The application using the subscription distributes the subscription public key
and authentication secret to an authorized Application Server.  This could be
sent along with other subscription information that is provided by the User
Agent, such as the push subscription URI.

An application MUST use an authenticated, confidentiality protected
communications medium for this purpose.  In addition to the reasons described in
{{!RFC8030}}, this ensures that the authentication secret is not revealed to
unauthorized entities, which can be used to generate push messages that will be
accepted by the User Agent.

Most applications that use push messaging have a pre-existing relationship with
an Application Server.  Any existing communication mechanism that is
authenticated and provides confidentiality and integrity, such as HTTPS
{{?RFC2818}}, is sufficient.


# Push Message Encryption {#encryption}

Push message encryption happens in four phases:

* A shared secret is derived using elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman {{ECDH}}
  ({{dh}}).

* The shared secret is then combined with the application secret to produce the
  input keying material used in {{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-encryption-encoding}}
  ({{combine}}).

* A content encryption key and nonce are derived using the process in
  {{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-encryption-encoding}}.

* Encryption or decryption follows according to
  {{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-encryption-encoding}}.

The key derivation process is summarized in {{summary}}.  Restrictions on the
use of the encrypted content coding are described in {{restrict}}.


## Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement {#dh}

For each new subscription that the User Agent generates for an Application, it
also generates a P-256 {{FIPS186}} key pair for use in elliptic-curve
Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) {{ECDH}}.

When sending a push message, the Application Server also generates a new ECDH
key pair on the same P-256 curve.

The ECDH public key for the Application Server is included as the "keyid"
parameter in the encrypted content coding header (see Section 2.1 of
{{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-encryption-encoding}}.

An Application combines its ECDH private key with the public key provided by the
User Agent using the process described in {{ECDH}}; on receipt of the push
message, a User Agent combines its private key with the public key provided by
the Application Server in the `keyid` parameter in the same way.  These
operations produce the same value for the ECDH shared secret.


## Push Message Authentication {#auth}

To ensure that push messages are correctly authenticated, a symmetric
authentication secret is added to the information generated by a User Agent.
The authentication secret is mixed into the key derivation process shown in
{{combine}}.

A User Agent MUST generate and provide a hard to guess sequence of 16 octets that
is used for authentication of push messages.  This SHOULD be generated by a
cryptographically strong random number generator {{!RFC4086}}.


## Combining Shared and Authentication Secrets {#combine}

The shared secret produced by ECDH is combined with the authentication secret
using HMAC-based key derivation function (HKDF) described in {{!RFC5869}}.  This
produces the input keying material used by
{{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-encryption-encoding}}.

The HKDF function uses SHA-256 hash algorithm {{FIPS180-4}} with the following
inputs:

salt:
: the authentication secret

IKM:
: the shared secret derived using ECDH

info:

: the concatenation of the ASCII-encoded string "WebPush: info", a zero octet,
  and the User Agent ECDH public key and the Application Server ECDH public key,
  both in the uncompressed point form defined in {{X9.62}}; that is

  ~~~
  key_info = "WebPush: info" || 0x00 || ua_public || as_public
  ~~~

L:
: 32 octets (i.e., the output is the length of the underlying SHA-256 HMAC
  function output)


## Encryption Summary {#summary}

This results in a the final content encryption key and nonce generation using
the following sequence, which is shown here in pseudocode with HKDF expanded
into separate discrete steps using HMAC with SHA-256:

~~~ inline
   -- For a User Agent:
   ecdh_secret = ECDH(ua_private, as_public)
   auth_secret = random(16)

   -- For an Application Server:
   ecdh_secret = ECDH(as_private, ua_public)
   auth_secret = <from User Agent>

   -- For both:
   PRK_key = HMAC-SHA-256(auth_secret, ecdh_secret)
   key_info = "WebPush: info" || 0x00 || ua_public || as_public
   IKM = HMAC-SHA-256(PRK_cek, key_info || 0x01)

   salt = random(16)
   PRK = HMAC-SHA-256(salt, IKM)
   cek_info = "Content-Encoding: aes128gcm" || 0x00
   CEK = HMAC-SHA-256(PRK, cek_info || 0x01)[0..15]
   nonce_info = "Content-Encoding: nonce" || 0x00
   NONCE = HMAC-SHA-256(PRK, nonce_info || 0x01)[0..11]
~~~

Note that this omits the exclusive OR of the final nonce with the record
sequence number, since push messages contain only a single record (see
{{restrict}}) and the sequence number of the first record is zero.


# Restrictions on Use of "aes128gcm" Content Coding {#restrict}

An Application Server MUST encrypt a push message with a single record.  This
allows for a minimal receiver implementation that handles a single record.  An
application server MUST set the `rs` parameter in the `aes128gcm` content coding
header to a size that is greater than the sum of the lengths of the plaintext,
the padding delimiter (1 octet), any padding, and the authentication tag (16
octets).

A push message MUST include the application server ECDH public key in the
`keyid` parameter of the encrypted content coding header.  The uncompressed
point form defined in {{X9.62}} (that is, a 65 octet sequence that starts with
a 0x04 octet) forms the entirety of the "keyid".

A push service is not required to support more than 4096 octets of payload body
(see Section 7.2 of {{!RFC8030}}).  Absent header (86 octets), padding (minimum
2 octets), and expansion for AEAD_AES_128_GCM (16 octets), this equates to at
most 3992 octets of plaintext.

An Application Server MUST NOT use other content encodings for push messages.
In particular, content encodings that compress could result in leaking of push
message contents.  The Content-Encoding header field therefore has exactly one
value, which is `aes128gcm`.  Multiple `aes128gcm` values are not permitted.

A User Agent is not required to support multiple records.  A User Agent MAY
ignore the `rs` field.  If a record size is unchecked, decryption will fail with
high probability for all valid cases.  The padding delimiter octet MUST be
checked, values other than 0x02 MUST cause the message to be discarded.


# Push Message Encryption Example {#example}

The following example shows a push message being sent to a push service.

~~~ example
POST /push/JzLQ3raZJfFBR0aqvOMsLrt54w4rJUsV HTTP/1.1
Host: push.example.net
TTL: 10
Content-Length: 145
Content-Encoding: aes128gcm

This example shows the ASCII encoded string, "When I grow up, I want to be a
watermelon". The content body is shown here with line wrapping and URL-safe
base64url encoding to meet presentation constraints.

The keys used are shown below using the uncompressed form {{X9.62}} encoded
using base64url.

# IANA Considerations {#iana}

\[\[RFC EDITOR: please remove this section before publication.]]
This document makes no request of IANA.

# Security Considerations

The security considerations of {{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-encryption-encoding}}
describe the limitations of the content encoding.  In particular, any HTTP
header fields are not protected by the content encoding scheme.  A User Agent
MUST consider HTTP header fields to have come from the Push Service.  An
application on the User Agent that uses information from header fields to alter
their processing of a push message is exposed to a risk of attack by the Push
Service.

The timing and length of communication cannot be hidden from the Push Service.
While an outside observer might see individual messages intermixed with each
other, the Push Service will see which Application Server is talking to which
User Agent, and the subscription that is used.  Additionally, the length of
messages could be revealed unless the padding provided by the content encoding
scheme is used to obscure length.

The User Agent and Application MUST verify that the public key they receive is
on the P-256 curve.  Failure to validate a public key can allow an attacker to
extract a private key.
